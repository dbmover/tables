# DbMover\Tables
Base table migration plugin for DbMover

## Installation

```sh
$ composer require dbmover/tables
```

## Usage
For general DbMover usage, see `dbmover/core`.

By itself this plugin doesn't do much; it only defines an abstract base class
for table migrations. This process typically differs per vendor.

## Contributing
